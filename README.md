OsmAnd (OSM Automated Navigation Directions)
------------
This project aims at providing comfortable map viewing and navigation (routing) application for mobile devices. Particular stress lies with complete offline features (via pre-loaded offline map data) or economic internet usage.
To get started, continue with the basic description below, then find more detail on our Welcome Wiki Pages, the Project Homepage, or the OpenStreetMap OsmAnd Wiki Page.
You are welcome to discuss any question regarding the project at the Google group OsmAnd. Please do not use comments on wiki pages because it is rather difficult to find them.

Functionality
-------------
**OsmAnd (OSM Automated Navigation Directions)** is a map and navigation application with access to the free, worldwide, and high-quality OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. All map data can be stored on your device's memory card for offline use. Via your device's GPS, OsmAnd offers routing, with optical and voice guidance, for car, bike, and pedestrian. All the main functionalities work both online and offline (no internet needed).

## Some of the main features:

 * Turn-by-turn voice guidance (recorded and synthesized voices)
 * Optional lane guidance, street name display, and estimated time of arrival
 * Supports intermediate points on your itinerary
 * Automatic re-routing whenever you deviate from the route
 * Search for places by address, by type (e.g. restaurant, hotel, gas station, museum), or by geographical coordinates

#### Map Viewing
 * Display your position and orientation on the map
 * Optionally align the map according to compass or your direction of motion

 * Also supports online or cached tile maps

#### Safety Features
 * Optional automated day/night view switching

 * Optional speed-dependent map zooming
 * Share your location so that your friends can find you

#### Bicycle and Pedestrian Features

 * Optional public transport stops (bus, tram, train) including line names
 * Optional trip recording to local GPX file or online service
 * Optional speed and altitude display
 * Display of contour lines and hill-shading (via additional plugin)

#### Directly Contribute to OpenStreetMap
 * Report map bugs
 * Upload GPX tracks to OSM directly from the app
 * Add POIs and directly upload them to OSM (or later if offline)
 * Optional trip recording also in background mode (while device is in sleep mode)

OsmAnd is open source and actively being developed.
