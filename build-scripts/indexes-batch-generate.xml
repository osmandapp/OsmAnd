	<!-- There are 3 subprocess : 	
		 1. Download fresh osm files from servers to 'directory_for_osm_files' (override existings).
		 2. Generate index files from all files in 'directory_for_osm_files' and put all indexes into 'directory_for_index_files'
		 3. Upload index files from 'directory_for_index_files' to googlecode. 
		 If directory directory_for_uploaded_files is specified all uploaded files will be moved to it 
		 All these subprocess could be ran independently ! So you can create some files check them and after that try to upload on googlecode,
		 or you can upload any file you have to googlecode (just put into 'directory_for_index_files')
