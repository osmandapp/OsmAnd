	// Map Refactoring
//      Remove notification from OsmAndMapTileView (?)
	
//		=== Refactoring issues ===
//	    !|| 125 || Introduce service layer rather than singletons and put all related into new package (services). Review architecture. Split some big classes. ||
	
//		=== Common issues ===
//      || 111 || Investigate showing street name while driving (Issue 286) ||  
//      || 86 || Allow to add/edit custom tags to POI objects (Issue 44) ||
//		|| 113 || Calculate speed cameras/bumps on the road (announce about them) (Issue 418) ||


	
//		=== Not clear if really needed (Means golden ratio complexity/necessity) ===
//		|| 66 || Transport routing (show next stop, total distance, show stop get out, voice) ||
//		|| 85 || Enable on/off screen for bike navigation ||
//		|| 83 || Add monitoring service to send locations to internet ||
	
	
//		=== Unscheduled (complex) ===
//		|| 65 || Intermediate points - for better control routing, to avoid traffic jams ...(?) ||

	///////////////////////////   DONE //////////////////////////////
	// DONE ANDROID :
//  || 110 || Use android voice for pronounce command (could be used in future to pronounce street) (Issue 70) ||

	// DONE SWING
