//	    == Osmand application (TODO 127) ==

//		=== Refactoring issues ===
//	    !|| 125 || Introduce service layer rather than singletons and put all related into new package (services). Review architecture. Split some big classes. ||
		
		
//		=== Common issues ===
//	    || 104 || Add activity to show current loaded indexes and information about them (Issue 366) ||
//      || 123 || Improve gpx file showing (very slow for big files) (Issue 412) ||
//      || 124 || Animated transition using only raster images (?) - skip animations (!) - don not render vectoring for animations (Issue 238) ||
//      || 122 || Frozen sqlite db images (bug?). When images are loaded into sqlite the whole map is frozen (issue 413) || 	
//      || 120 || Show icons over poi circle (issue 414) ||
//      || 110 || Use android voice for pronounce command (could be used in future to pronounce street) (Issue 70) ||
//      || 119 || Dialog on main screen tips and tricks (Issue 415) ||
//      || 118 || Config switching between maps on different zoom levels <14 (using raster), > 14 vector (Issue 419) ||
//		|| 97 || For voice navigation consider current speed of vehicle. Especially when speed > 50 pronounce more than 200 m (Issue 420) ||
//      || 111 || Investigate showing street name while driving (Issue 286) ||  
//      || 86 || Allow to add/edit custom tags to POI objects (Issue 44) ||
//		|| 92 || Support poi index with standard map index and unify POI categories (unify done +, works very slow) (Issue 417) ||
//		|| 113 || Calculate speed cameras/bumps on the road (announce about them) (Issue 418) ||


	
//		=== Not clear if really needed (Means golden ratio complexity/necessity) ===
//		|| 66 || Transport routing (show next stop, total distance, show stop get out, voice) ||
//		|| 85 || Enable on/off screen for bike navigation ||
//		|| 83 || Add monitoring service to send locations to internet ||
	
	
//		=== Unscheduled (complex) ===
//		|| 65 || Intermediate points - for better control routing, to avoid traffic jams ...(?) ||

	// 	_19. colors for road trunk and motorway

	// DONE ANDROID :
