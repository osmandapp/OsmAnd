                Oh hi there! üòÑ

                To expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one.
                Existing issues often contain information about workarounds, resolution, or progress updates.

                GitHub is our main development tool for our developers. There are hundreds of requests a month and there are relatively few developers.
                So by opening an issue, please know that your issue will be sent out to all developers and acknowledge that it could be closed without explanation or with just a brief message.
                Comments on the closed issues are also sent to all developers, so you definitely will be heard.
                However, there is no guarantee that a developer will pick up the issue to work on it.

                Please be sure to read our [FAQ](https://osmand.net/docs/user/troubleshooting/) before creating an issue here.

                The best way to get help about is to provide as many details as possible and follow the below template
                so that we can try to **reproduce** your issue.
